## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use different attributes of flexbox for formatting diferent elements.

Another thing that I have learned is how to chain classes and ID's for different elements, here are some examples:

```css
.testimonial-header img {
    border-radius: 50%;
}

.header-text {
    margin-left: 1rem;
}

.header-text .graduate-name {
    opacity: 100%;
    font-weight: 600;
    margin-bottom: 0;
}

.header-text .verified-text {
    opacity: 70%;
    margin-top: 0;
}

.main-testimony {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
    font-weight: 600;
}

.sub-testimony {
    opacity: 70%;
}

.main-testimony,
.sub-testimony {
    line-height: 150%;
}
```

### Continued development

After this project I will try to recreate the way its formatted for testimonial pages that I plan on doing in the future.
